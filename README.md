## Setting up the computer

### Setting up Raspberry pi
The Raspberry Pi was setup and accessed in headless mode.

#### Prepare SD card
* This was done using in a Windows OS.
* For SD cards with more than 32GB size, the file system is exFAT and not FAT32. But RPi does not recognize exFAT, hence change it to FAT32 to work. Used a [3rd party software](https://www.diskpart.com/download-home.html) to do this for our 64GB SD card.
* Used [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to flash Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS to the SD card.
* Before flashing, do ctrl+shift+x to open image customization options. There we can set the hostname, enable SSH and configure wifi. Helps to avoid using monitors and do a headless setup.
* After flashing, insert SD card into the slot in Raspberry Pi and connect the power supply (PTron power bank via USB c cable) to the Raspberry Pi.
* Successful setup should ensure    
    - Constant red LED - Indicates sufficient power.
    - Blinking green LED - Indicates that the SD card is being accessed.

#### Access Raspberry Pi remotely
Make sure the Raspberry Pi and the PC are connected to the same network.
* Open the terminal
* To install necessary tools for SSH
```
sudo apt install nmap
sudo apt-get install openssh-client
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
```
* To get the local IP address
```
hostname -I
```
* Replace the last number of the local IP address with 0/24 to the subnet range (Eg: if the local IP address is 192.168.43.68 then...)
```
nmap -sn 192.168.43.0/24
```
From this, we will get the IP address of Raspberry Pi.
* To establish an SSH connection using the IP address of Raspberry Pi, username and password we will be requires to access the Pi remotely
```
ssh <username>@<ip_address>
```
This would then prompt the user to enter the password, after which remote access will be established.

### Setting up Catkin Workspace
